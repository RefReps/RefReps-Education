- **Upcoming plans:
  - Header bar (or something) to identify which user is logged in

    - Potential having 2 different links for authors and students (meh)
    - differentiating between authors and students both trying to get into a course
  - Expanding course creation/copying form
     - Enforcements
     - teachable method:
       - Admins create course
       - Authors fill out questionaire and a new course is made for them from the template courses 
  - Progression:
    - allow progression from quizzesthrough either: min grade reached or max attempts used
    - video watch time enforcements - difficult, and hasn't been working for other companies
      - scrap 90% watch time enforcements
      - 1st watch through, block students from scrubbing through video
      - additional views can allow scrubbing
      - On Teachable:
        - Publish: students can take
        - Visable: students can view
        - Visable + publish = view and take
        - Not visable + publish = cant see or take
        - Visable + not published = can see but not take (shown grayed out)
  - Adding textboxes
  - Tightening/cleaning up quizzes

## Things Clarified
- Current method for inviting members to a course in teachable:
    - Creates a code tied to a course
    - Sent to users that they can then use to become a member of the course
    - User must login/register
    - Then enter the coupon code their given to enroll in course
      - Used by both authors and students
    - Coupons have a limited number of uses and limited time to be used
    - ** Coupon is not related to payment plans **
- Inviting users to a course in the future:
  - Want to be able to see and limit how many users can be in a course
  - Button for the author to invite students
- Authors in a course:
  - allow multiple authors in a course such as teaching assistants etc.
- Button along bottom of current RefReps app to take them to Refprep -- single sign on
  - Keep current log in page for now
  - Want to be able to see what password text is (eyeball icon, yknow)
- Look at RefReps account creation for information 
- Schools have their own group code
  - think about allowing students to enter the group code that allows them enroll by seeing their schools courses
- **Need to get design documents from Braden again
- Next meeting 3/3/2022 @4:30p.m.
- Possible meeting 3/10/2022 (during Spring Break) if needed

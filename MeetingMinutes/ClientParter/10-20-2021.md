## Topics Discussed

- showed current progress on front-end and back-end
- goals for next meeting: uploading multiple videos, organizing videos, uploading videos in their preselected order
- the videos need to be able to be unembedded (rather than completely deleted)
- when uploading multiple videos the client wants to be able to select a maximum of 40 videos
 

## Things Clarified

- the videos are uploaded within a module and don't need to be preorganized
- the videos don't need to be renamed or add a description
- future: have a user view of the videos, allow multiple quizzes per module

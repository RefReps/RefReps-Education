 - Understanding the purpose of the company: training referees for the gap between learning by the book and actual practical applications for employment
 - software they use: RefReps, RefPreps, teachable, freedcamp
   - RefReps: uses real footage from referees to test users on how to make correct calls during a game
   - RefPrep: lecture based learning, with more technical aspects, not a lot of practical application more focused on the written rules
     - RefPrep is currently hosted on teachable but limits what the company is able to do with it and wants to incorporate the practical learning tools from RefReps
 - discussed possible development tools: Xamarin, Angular, Flutter
 - Main functional elements for streaming:
   - tracking viewership
   - individual watch time
   - per-user tracking viewership
   - (low rn) setting requirements on videos. like completing 90% before next video

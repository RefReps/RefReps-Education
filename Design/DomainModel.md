# Classes
## Video
Videos will enforce student watch time. A video is locked until the previous video's required watch time has been met. Videos are provided by RefReps team through Database access. 

## Curriculum 
A curricuclum contains all the quizes and videos a student must complete. A curriculum will display a cover photo and description when displayed in a view. Ideally, a curriculum would would have a release schedule for vidoes and quizes, and a certificate builder. 

## Curriculum Builder
A curriculum builder is used to set up a curriculum. This will be done by an instructor filling out a form. An admin can use this to link curriculums to videos and quizzes. 

## Quiz
Quizzes can be either multiple choice or true and false. As a bonus feature, we could add short answer questions. 

## User
Users are anyone who accesses the RefReps platform. They use an account to access the RefReps system. 

## Administrator 
The administrator (usually someone at the RefReps team) manages videos and quizzes. An administrator is a user. 

## Student
Students are the main users who watch videos and take quizes. The system will track what videos they've watched, and they're video watch time. 

## Teacher
Teachers can assign students to a course.

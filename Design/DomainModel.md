# Classes
## Video
Videos will enforce student watch time. A video is locked until the previous video's required watch time has been met. Vidoes are provided by RefReps team through Database access. 

## Curriculum 
A curricuclum contains all the quizes and videos a student must complete. A curriculum will display a cover photo and description when displayed in a view. Ideally, a curriculum would would have a release schedule for vidoes and quizes, and a certificate builder. 

## Curriculum Builder
A curriculum builder is used to set up a curriculum. This will be done by an instructor filling out a form. An admin can use this to link curriculums to videos and quizzes. 

## Quiz
Quizzes can be either multiple choice or true and false. As a bonus feature, we could add short answer questions.

## Administrator

# Classes
## Video
Videos will enforce student watch time. A video is locked until the previous video's required watch time has been met. Videos are provided by RefReps team through Database access. 

## Curriculum 
A curricuclum contains all the quizes and videos a student must complete. A curriculum will display a cover photo and description when displayed in a view. Ideally, a curriculum would would have a release schedule for vidoes and quizes, and a certificate builder. 

## Curriculum Builder
A curriculum builder is used to set up a curriculum. This will be done by an Administrator. An admin can use this to link curriculums to videos and quizzes. 

## Quiz
Quizzes can be either multiple choice or true and false. As a bonus feature, we could add short answer questions. 

## User
Users are anyone who accesses the RefReps platform. They use an account to access the RefReps system. 

## Administrator 
The administrator (usually someone at the RefReps team) manages videos and quizzes. An administrator is a user. 

## Student
Students are the main users who watch videos and take quizes. The system will track what videos they've watched, and they're video watch time. 

## Teacher
Teachers can assign students to a course. 

## Course Builder
The course builder is a form that instructors use to create a course. A course is generated based on a chosen curriculum provided by RefReps. (e.g, RefReps creates Basketball Officiating 101, then while filling out the course builder form, the instructor selectes Basketball Officiating 101 and the course is generated based on what RefReps has inside of Basketball Occiciating 101) 

## Course 
A course is what students and instructors actually interact with. A course is essentially an instance of a curriculum.

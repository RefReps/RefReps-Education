## Paragraphs 
- Hunter 
  - Overall, I though that the time spent presenting at the symposium was a good experience to explain our project in a somewhat business manner, along with breifly explaining our learning experiences throughout the process. It was nice explaining our project to non-super techical people and talk about the use cases that our software is used for (without going into too many details of how the technical parts worked). I liked the interests that most of the people showed when we talked to the about our project because they seemed to follow what we were explaining and asking us more specific cases that our project would be used for.
- Annie 
  - The symposium was really interesting to see the other projects students had been working on and listening to how they explained their in depth research in simpler terms and compare it to how I was explaining our project to people. The first people that came up got a very different spiel from the people at the end as I tried to figure out the key points to talk about and parts to highlight that I thought might be interesting rather than the specific technical parts. It was really refreshing talking about the project in just a basic, broad strokes, way rather than the technical presentations we've been doing. Trying to tell people about *why* we made the software and how/if we solved the problem we were trying to solve was really reflective.
- Max 
  - The student symposium was a nice experience. It was nice to share our creation with people and the presenting helped us give an "Elevator" pitch of the application and its capabilities. It will definitely help us with the future presentations of our project. I thought we got a decent amount of people to come see our project and they all were pretty satisfied. 
- Jacob
  - This was a unique experience. It was a new challenge to present our project to people who aren't as tech savy as us. I'm sure today will serve as good experience towards talking about our project during future job interviews. When I wasn't at our table, I enjoyed walking around and seeing all the other projects present. I didn't talk to too many other presenters. Honestly it was almost intimidating walking up to people standing in front of posters they're clearly passionate about, full of words I didn't understand.

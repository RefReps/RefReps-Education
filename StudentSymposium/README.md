 - The student symposium was a nice experience. It was nice to share our creation with people and the presenting helped us give an "Elevator" pitch of the application and its capabilities. It will definitely help us with the future presentations of our project. I thought we got a decent amount of people to come see our project and they all were pretty satisfied.

-- This was a unique experience. It was a new challenge to present our project to people who aren't as tech savy as us. I'm sure today will serve as good experience towards talking about our project during future job interviews. When I wasn't at our table, I enjoyed walking around and seeing all the other projects present. I didn't talk to too many other presenters. Honestly it was almost intimidating walking up to people standing in front of posters they're clearly passionate about, full of words I didn't understand.
